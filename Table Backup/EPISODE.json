      "DESCRIPTION": "Rex is stalked by a carnivorous rabbit E.V.O. that he insulted. Surprisingly, every time they meet, Rex is dealt a humiliating defeat made all the worse when Noah convinces Rex to be his wingman for Prom night. The girl Noah set Rex up with is named Annie who is almost supernaturally clumsy, having a bad habit of putting her dates in the hospital or worse. Noah set Rex up with Annie because he is the only one who could possibly survive the night with her. Shockingly, Annie's clumsiness proves to be an asset when Rex uses it to blow the rabbit E.V.O. up with a heat seeker missile. After the prom, the girls agree this is the best date they ever had but Rex states that despite Annie being nice and cute, he'll never go on a date with her again.",

Once the boys arrive at the camp, they must dissect E.V.O.s, do sit-ups until they puke (literally), and even brush their teeth a specific way. When Rex and Noah fail a crash landing test and are ordered to do it over and over again until they do it correctly, they realize this may not be as easy as they thought. Things take a turn for the worse when a cadet, Kenwyn, who is angry at Rex for dropping her rank from #1, turns off the power restraint collar placed on E.V.O.s agents in training must battle. As a twist, the General sends her down instead of Rex since Rex fought it eariler in the episode. All the E.V.O.s, including Weaver, break loose and wreak havoc until Kenwyn works with Noah and a very helpful extra to distract the E.V.O.s so Rex can beat them. These four graduate from Basic Training and Noah and Rex are seen walking down the Stone Steps, betting money on who will make it to the bottom first.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "The final 10 seconds of the first half feature a block from Kagami on Aomine and then a blocked fast break. During halftime, Seirin decides they must bench Kuroko so he can regain some strength, forcing Kagami and Aomine into a one-on-one battle. Aomine displays amazing speed but realizes he can't play honest ball against Kagami if he is to be successful. He breaks out solo street-ball movements that no one on Seirin can stop and then taunts Kuroko telling him to get ready to come on out.",

Back in the locker rooms Aomine defends Kuroko (who is being talked bad about by one of the bench warmers) and Kagami tells Kuroko that he doesn't think that working together will help them win anymore. Kagami is benched for the next two matches due to leg damage and Kuroko hits a slump, his passes becoming inaccurate. Seirin loses both games effectively kicking them out of the Interhigh tournament. Seirin's last chance of redemption is the Winter Cup but with nobody has recovered from their previous loss to Tōō High. With Kagami playing by himself again, and the unease between him and Kuroko things aren't looking so good. Seirin's former ace and founder of the basketball club shows up with words of encouragement for Kuroko and a challenge for Kagami.",

Kurapika and Leorio talk about the reason for being a hunter, with Kurapika wanting to take down the Phantom Troupe as his clan was massacred by them for their precious scarlet eyes, which manifest when the Kurta uses their heightened sense. Leorio aims to be a hunter for money, for purely altruistic reasons, as his childhood friend died of an illness without the funds to save him. He wishes to be a doctor so he can give his patients free treatment.

The test run is a success until ZAG-RS, the rogue AI system from the village of engineers from The Architect, hacks into the satelite to steal the deactivated nanite research. Holiday manages to shut down the satellites' systems thus preventing the download and trapping ZAG-RS but causes the satelite to enter orbital decay. Rex arrives to help using the Space Elevator but the damage done to the elevator destroys it. With the assistance of a drone named Salvator, Rex is able to stabilize the station with an escape pod with Rex, the surviving crew and nanites on board. However, it is eventually revealed that ZAG-RS downloaded herself into Salvator to avoid the effect of the shut down and now intends to leave everyone else on the satellite while she escapes to earth in Salvator with the nanites and the research. However, Rex and Dr. Holiday are able to defeat ZAG-RS by both destabilizing the station and sacrificing the nanites. The episode ends with a crew member, Dr. Holiday, and Rex in an escape pod in the middle of the ocean awaiting pickup.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "Gon and Kurapika reunite with Leorio and Killua at the Phase Two site. Satotz leads what remains of the candidates to meet the second phase examiners, named Menchi and Buhara. The examiners declare the next phase is to test their cooking skills, much to the candidates' disbelief. The test requires pork, so the candidates are sent to find pigs in the forest. However, the pigs living inside the forest are carnivorous and tear through the candidates. Thanks to Gon, they discover the pigs' weakness and they manage to each get one for their cooking. Upon tasting the candidates' cooking, Buhara gives a pass but Menchi fails all of them. Knowing the candidates will riot, Satotz informs Chairman Netoros of the Hunter Selection Committee to make an appearance. Netoros arrives to correct Menchi's habit of getting biased whenever it's related to cooking. Netoros allows Menchi to stay on as examiner, and she gives the candidates a retest: boil eggs laid by spider eagles on Mt. Split-in-Half.",

Kotori fell over after Kurumi's last shot but Kotori's healing skill enables her to not die. Then, the shocked Kurumi sent her copies to kill Shido but he was pushed away by Kotori and the copies were killed. In the heat of the fight, Kurumi used one of her skills to inhibit Kotori but it only worked for a while. Kotori used her weapon to shoot Kurumi's angel after the frightened Kurumi summoned her copies to shield her. Shido immediately stood in front of Kurumi to shield her, knowing Kotori is no longer herself when he tries to reason with Kotori to not kill Kurumi. After the shot launched, Kotori suddenly regained conscious and deflected the shot. Shido woke up on Fraxinus after dreaming of the event that happened 5 years ago. He went to meet Kotori for information of her powers after being calmed down by Reine. He left in despair to meet Mana and Origami in the hospital after he heard from Reine about Kotori's condition. Being unable to meet Mana, Shido instead met Origami, who tried to get him closer to herself. Before Shido exited Origami's room in the late evening, she told him of her intent to kill the Spirit of Fire to avenge her parent's death five years ago and that's the reason that she joined AST.",

An experienced rock climber candidate tries to climb down but is eaten by some flying monsters. Later, Kurapika finds that more than half of the candidates have discovered hidden doors to go inside the tower, which Gon finds one as well.

Kendall invites Jo, as his 'guest-friend-person-thing', while James invites the 3 hottest girls on his phone. It is unknown who Logan invited. Carlos cannot decide and ends up inviting the first 3 contacts on his phone and one of them is 'All Contacts' (Carlos thought it was \"Al Contacts\", thus inviting his whole phone). During the \"social gathering,\" everybody in Carlos phone is now in the party which causes a big problem. Soon, Bitters is hunting for their party, so Kendall and Jo try to stop him before the boys get \"3 strikes\" and are thrown out of the Palm Woods.

      "DESCRIPTION": "The boys have been breaking things while having too much fun at the Palm Woods and Gustavo has had enough. Rather than covering for them, Gustavo decides to teach the guys a lesson by making them get jobs to pay off $2,000.30 for the damages. Gustavo puts the boys on Freight Train's \"No-Swim list\" so they cannot swim in the Palmwoods pool until they pay all of the money back. Carlos becomes Gustavo's production assistant, while James attempts to become a model with Katie as his manager. At first, Logan and Kendall were going to be sign spinners. However, they get fired and start a babysitting service, which was not as easy as they expected. Eventually, Kendall and Logan make the kids wash cars. When Carlos is getting a coffee for Gustavo using an automated coffee maker C.A.L. (very likely a parody of H.A.L.), it makes a coffee with foam, and when it asks Carlos if he wants more foam, C.A.L. keeps on squirting more and more foam until the kitchen is full of it and more and proclaims it wants to cover the Earth in foam. The boys eventually pay Gustavo back his money, but then, people come storming in asking who will pay for setting up an illegal daycare service in the Palm Woods, using Palm Woods rags and towels, James' wardrobe, the coffee machine, and foam removal. Gustavo gets angry and wrecks his studio. Griffin sees this and asks him to pay him back the exact same amount of money the boys get fined. The episode ends with Gustavo, Kelly, and the boys washing cars.",

As they made their way to their orientation, they were greeted by a beautiful young woman, who presented Mitsuo with a bouquet of roses and then proceeded to smack him with them before leaving. Mitsuo later explained that the woman was Kouko Kaga, his childhood friend, and arranged fiancé, whom he had run away from as he does not reciprocate her feelings. After orientation, Banri and Mitsuo learn that Kouko was also a student at their university, much to Mitsuo's horror. She became acquainted with Banri during a shared class, and he soon became smitten. After class, Banri met and befriended freshman Chinami Oka and Linda, a second year student and member of the Japanese Festival Culture Research Club. On his way home, he once again runs into Kouko, who used his phone to locate Mitsuo, but upon returning it, he noticed the phone number for a hospital, causing him to remember a time when he was on a bridge and was seemingly run over by a motorbike.

The next day, Kōko openly expresses her love for Banri as they walk to school, and their relationship is met with disbelief from Nijigen, and mild surprise from Mitsuo, who has dyed his hair blonde out of depression from being rejected. When Chinami comes to greet them Mitsuo flees, and Chinami says that he has been avoiding her, while explaining the reason she rejected him was because his confession was made in public. Linda soon appears, and Banri flees, noting that he has been avoiding Linda since their last conversation, despite her constant attempts to speak with him again. As time passes, Banri and Kōko enjoy their time as a couple, but Banri continues to ignore Linda, which upsets her, and causes Nana to take notice. One day, Banri is called back to his apartment because of a plumbing leak, but when he arrives he meets Nana again, who reveals that she is his neighbor, and that she faked the leak to get him to meet with Linda. Back in Banri's apartment, he apologizes for his behavior, and the two rekindle their friendship, just as Banri gets a call from Kōko who worries that Mitsuo might be in trouble.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Roles are assigned by amida drawing. Sakura has the role of the prince and Syaoran is the princess. The two have lunch with Yukito, who asks about the play. Sakura and Syaoran are too embarrassed to tell him what roles they are playing. They agree to practice their lines together in the morning at school. Toya makes Sakura breakfast and warns her about doing \"reckless\" things. Sakura meets Syaoran in a hallway and the Sand card rushes around behind them. They practice outside and almost get to the kissing scene, when the Sand card forms a vortex around them. They get away using Fly, but Syaoran gets caught in the vortex again. Sakura uses Watery and Syaoran uses Freeze to freeze the Sand. Sakura seals the card and it comes to both of them, but she lets Syaoran have it.",

Meilin runs off, calling Syaoran an idiot. At the end of school, Sakura invites Meilin to her house and they have a chat with tea and sweets. Sakura tries to make Meilin feel that she is not a nuisance to Syaoran. Meilin tells Sakura about how she fell in love with Syaoran. In the middle of their conversation, Sakura senses a Clow Card. Meilin decides not to go, but Sakura drags her along and tells her there are things only she can do. Meanwhile, Syaoran is getting beaten by the Twin card. After a couple of failed attempts, Sakura thinks that Meilin and Syaoran can work together to keep the two bodies of the Twin card immobilized, so she can seal them away; they try it, and it works. Sakura seals the Twin card, and it goes to Syaoran because he and Meilin weakened it. Syaoran tells Meilin that he never thought that she was in his way. Sakura, Tomoyo, and Kero go to the airport with Syaoran to say goodbye to Wei and Meilin. Meilin asks Syaoran if he remembers the promise, which is until Syaoran finds a girl he likes more than her, she will be his bride. Meilin whispers a thank you to Sakura for saving them with her magic, before she leaves.",

Ms. Mizuki explains to Sakura that Yukito is Yue. Yue begins the Final Judgment of Syaoran, who tries to fight Yue with a seal, but Yue tells him that it is useless, and he can only use the Clow Cards he currently has. Syaoran tries to use the Time card, but since it is under Yue's jurisdiction, Yue can use it against him. Syaoran is defeated, and it is time for Sakura's Final Judgment.",

So he and Fred call an old friend, Ginny Jones, for dates so that they can go to the nightclub and spy on their wives. Coincidentally, Lucy and Ethel have also called Ginny about getting dates to go to the club. When Ginny tells the girls about the boys' plans, Lucy decides that she and Ethel will impersonate the boys' blind dates. Thus, the two of them enter the Ricardo apartment decked out like country bumpkins, which makes for some superb Lucille Ball schtick.",

At the training grounds, Tatsumi and Lubbock are taking push-ups, with Akame and Leone respectively sitting on their backs. Najenda later tells Night Raid that she will be leaving to recruit new members and assigns Akame as temporary leader. At the Capital, Wave tries to make an impression as other Imperial Arms users, namely Kurome, Seryu, Dr. Stylish, Run, and Bols, come and introduce themselves one by one. Esdeath arrives and introduces herself to the group, called the Jaegers, then announces their intention to hunt down enemies of the Empire. At Lubbock's library, Lubbock, Tatsumi, and Leone learn that Mine is now included in the Wanted list and an upcoming tournament sponsored by Esdeath is to be held at the Capital. Tatsumi pretends to be a blacksmith and joins the tournament, where he flawlessly defeats a muscular opponent without using his Incursio. Esdeath suddenly becomes infatuated over Tatsumi's fighting prowess and approaches him. Tatsumi thinks that the reward for winning the tournament is money, but instead, he is shackled by Esdeath and taken inside the Palace. Learning of Tatsumi's capture, Akame and the others wonder whether they should rescue Tatsumi.",

Najenda introduces Susanoo and Chelsea, the girl from the previous episode. After their introduction, Chelsea berates Night Raid for their incompetence, which she alleges led to Sheele and Bulat's deaths. Angered, Mine decides to teach Chelsea a lesson and recruits Lubbock and Tatsumi, the latter of whom uses Incursio to sneak on the hot spring where Chelsea is bathing. However, Tatsumi instead confronts Susanoo, but it is actually Chelsea using her Teigu, Gaea Foundation, which changes her physical appearance. Chelsea tells her story about her former team being massacred, leaving her as the only survivor, and she reveals that she berated Night Raid because she didn't want them to die like her former team did. Meanwhile, a depressed Esdeath learns of the loss of Dr. Stylish and comforts Seryu when she grieves his death. At the Capital, Run tells Esdeath that there are many lookalikes of Tatsumi for her to court, but Esdeath declares that there is only one Tatsumi. At the mining caves, miners are being devoured by modified Danger Beasts while watched by a hooded man.",

With Kirito revealing his new technique of using consecutive Sword Skills with each of his swords to avoid the period of rigidity, they are able to defeat the two minotaurs.

Instead of running away, Freyja asks to join the group and Kirito reluctantly agrees to the request.

Kirito, who beta-tested the game, log-ins to the world of Aincrad and meets Klein, a new player who asks him to teach him the basics of the game including the battle system, explaining there is no magic so they mostly use sword combat. However, Kirito and Klein cannot log out of the game for some reason. As most of the players head to the village square, a red-hooded figure suddenly appears in the sky. The figure reveals himself to be Akihiko Kayaba, the game's creator and tells them they cannot log-out was made on purpose. Furthermore, he reveals they cannot log-out by simply removing the NerveGear, the VR helmet they use to log-in the game as it will kill them instantly. The only way to log out is for the players to beat and clear all 100 floors of the game and should they die in the game, their real bodies will die as well. As a parting gift, Akihiko gives them a mirror which reveals their real looks on their avatars. As everyone goes into shock of their new predicament, Kirito ask Klein to follow him to the next village to level up as soon as possible but Klein politely declines as he wishes to remain with his friends but promises to see him again. Kirito heads out, vowing to be free from this game. By the end of the first month, 2,000 players have died and the 1st floor has yet to be cleared.",

As Kirito saves her, he tells Silica of an item at the Hill of Memories on the 47th floor that can revive her familiar within three days after it's death, offering to accompany her there. As they spend time together, Kirito warns Silicia of \"orange players\", players who attack other players and \"red players\", players who kill other players and someone is eavesdropping on their plans. As they make their way towards the Hill of Memories the next day, Kirito tells Silica about his younger sister who is actually his cousin, who she reminds him of. As they finally retrieve the item, the Pneuma Flower, they are confronted by Rosalia and her men, who are actually part of the Titan's Hand, a notorious orange player guild and are after Silica's flower. However, Kirito reveals part of his reason for escorting Silica was to draw Rosalia out to arrest her. The guild realizes Kirito is the infamous Beater \"The Black Swordsman\", and due to his higher levels and advanced skills, he outmatches Rosalia and her men, forcing them to surrender and send them to prison. As Kirito prepares to return to the front lines, he makes a promise to Silica that they'll meet again in the real world as she revives Pina.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "Cities are growing at a faster rate than any other habitat on Earth. They may seem an unlikely place for animals to thrive, but for the bold this is a world of surprising opportunity. Leopards prowl the streets of Mumbai, peregrine falcons hunt amongst New York’s skyscrapers and a million starlings perform spectacular aerial dances over Rome. We welcome some creatures into our cities; in Jodhpur langurs are revered as religious deities and in Harar locals live in harmony with wild hyenas. Many animals, however, are struggling to cope in the urban jungle. As the architects of this environment will we choose to build cities that create a home for both us and for wildlife?",

Parties are formed, and Kirito teams up with a young girl named Asuna. The next day, Diabel's raid group arrives at the boss' room and battles Illfang and his minions. When Illfang's health becomes low, Diabel goes for the finishing attack. Kirito attempts to warn him, but Illfang attacks down first and mortally wounds Diabel. As he dies, Diabel begs Kirito to defeat the boss and save the players. Though they destroy the boss, Kirito is accused of being a \"beater\"—a combination of a \"beta-tester\" and \"cheater\"—for Diabel's death.",

Kirito, Asuna and Klein keep exploring the floor, clearing the monsters there, just to learn that the army is confronting the boss by themselves despite Kirito's warnings, and to make matters worse, the teleport crystals do not work in the boss room. As the members of the army are killed one by one, they launch themselves aganst the boss to protect the survivors and Kirito is forced to deploy a special skill of his he used to keep in secret that allows him to fight with two weapons, one in each hand, defeating the boss with a series of quick strikes. After the fight, Kirito collapses with HP almost totally depleted, just to wake up instants later, seeing Asuna in tears, who asks him to form a party with him, to which he agrees. Some time later, Kirito and Asuna are brought before Heathcliff, commander of the Knights of Blood who challenges him to a duel. If Kirito wins, Asuna is allowed to leave the guild and join his side, but he must join the guild instead should he loses. Kirito agrees to the terms and accepts Heathcliff's challenge.",

As the time for the battle approaches, Kirito asks Asuna to stay behind fearing for her safety, but Asuna refuses, claiming that she rathers to die than to live without him. She also mentions that all players' real bodies must be currently being treated in hospitals and their condition can not be kept indefinetly, thus fleeing to live by themselves inside the game is out of question. As the players enter the boss room, they are confronted with \"The Skull Reaper\", a powerful monster capable of killing players with one blow.

She and Kirito then decide to follow Death Gun, eventually going to the Lost City. However, since they could not find him along the way, they look for him during the next scan. Seeing that two players, Sterben and Juushi X (銃士Ｘ, Jūshi X?), were present in the city, they decide to go after Juushi X, as his name sounded like Death Gun (死銃, Shijū?) backwards. During the scan, they find Juushi X at a stadium, while Sterben abruptly vanishes from the city. The two rush to the stadium and, after confirming that there was a sniper, decide to split up. However, as Sinon takes a sniping position, she is suddenly shot with a stun bullet. Death Gun, who is actually Sterben, appears and proclaims that he is going to kill her. Sinon tries to defend herself, but then sees that Sterben is carrying the Type 54 Black Star, the same weapon she used to kill the robber at the post office.",

Liver notices Bulat's determination despite this growing disadvantage and uses a special attack that finally wears out Incursio. Now without Incursio, Bulat decides to engage Liver in a sword fight. Liver tries recruiting Bulat to Esdeath's army, but he refuses, realizing that his former general's views have changed. The two fight, and both eventually wound each other. Mortally wounded, Liver reveals before dying that the reason he joined Esdeath is simply because he admired her. Though victorious, Bulat finds that his wounds are poisoned from a last-resort attack inflicted by Liver. He subsequently entrusts his Incursio to Tatsumi so the latter could use it against Nyau, who taunts Tatsumi and doesn't believe he will be compatible with the Imperial Arm. However, Tatsumi proves to be compatible with Bulat's Incursio, and with it, he kills Nyau. Despite Tatsumi's victory, Bulat succumbs to his wounds, and Tatsumi mourns for his mentor. Elsewhere, a girl, Kurome, is informed that she has been chosen to be a part of a new group, and she believes this could be a chance to see her sister again.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "Team Stylish carries out their attack on the Night Raid base, and multiple foot soldiers are killed during the assault, while Leone is incapacitated by a member named Trooma. One of the members, Toby, decides to duel Akame, and she is unable to fatally poison him with her Imperial Arm, Murasame, because his body is mostly machine due to it being installed with multiple weapons, but she is eventually able to kill him after he is impaled by Lubbock in an ambush. Meanwhile, Tatsumi fights Kaku, another member of Team Stylish, and is shocked to find that he has possession of Ecstasy, Sheele's old Imperial Arm. The battle is interrupted by Mine, who is also horrified to see Ecstasy, and she quickly kills Kaku, safely retrieving Ecstasy. Trooma prepares to ambush Mine, but is attacked by Leone, who had recovered, and she accidentally kills him with a single blow, to her displeasure. After Night Raid regroups, everyone but Tatsumi suddenly collapses, having been afflicted with a paralytic poison during the battle. When more foot soldiers move in, a biological Imperial Arm named Susanoo intervenes and dispatches them. Outmatched, Dr. Stylish injects himself with a liquid that turns him into a Danger Beast, and he consumes his remaining men. Tatsumi, Akame, and Susanoo fight Dr. Stylish before he is shot by Mine, allowing Akame to slash Dr. Stylish's real body contained in the Danger Beast, killing him. Najenda and a girl observe the aftermath of the battle.",

Esdeath and Tatsumi are teleported to a remote island, where they are confronted by a gigantic modified Danger Beast created from Dr. Stylish's experiments. After it repels Esdeath's attacks, the Danger Beast is slain by Tatsumi. As night falls, Tatsumi and Esdeath decide to tell each other their back-stories; Tatsumi fakes his, while Esdeath reveals that she hailed from a clan that hunted Danger Beasts, with her father telling her that the strongest will survive and the weak shall fall. When her clan was attacked by a rivaling tribe and all of its members killed, she was told by her dying father that the clan was weak and that she needed to live strong. As a result, Esdeath enlisted in the Imperial army and ended up becoming a skilled general. Now thinking about getting off the island, Esdeath tries to hunt a flying Danger Beast, but Syura's teleport field appears and they jump in. Although they return back to the mountains, Tatsumi flees using his Incursio. Realizing that Esdeath cannot be convinced, he vows that the next time they meet, it will be as enemies.",

Though the aliens escaped from Aggregor's spaceship, they crash-landed on Earth. After Ben's Ultimatrix scans Galapagus' DNA, he arranges for the Plumbers to get Galapagus back to his home planet. Unfortunately for Galapagus, Aggregor was posing as a Plumber.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "Eager to escape his containment suit, P'andor (one of the aliens who were captured by Aggregor) offers a huge cash reward to anyone who can break him out of it. Everyone who tries to break the suit ranging from Buzz, Hammer, and Surgeon fails, save for Kevin, who uses a piece of Taednite to pierce it. But, when Kevin's Plumber's badge senses that the contents of P'andor's suit are radioactive, he stops trying to open it. Enraged, P'andor then offers Buzz, Hammer, and Surgeon an even bigger reward if they capture Kevin. Kevin escapes, but he accidentally leaves his piece of Taednite behind. P'andor tries to use it to break his suit open, but only after failing to do so, he realizes that he needs Kevin's help. He sends his hired minions to kidnap Kevin, and then tricks him into using the Taednite to slash his suit open. Freed from his suit, P'andor heads for a power plant to absorb all of the nuclear energy inside. Working together, Ben and Kevin are able to trap P'andor back inside his suit, and deliver him to a pair of Plumbers who offer to take him back to his home world. Unfortunately, Aggregor intercepts the Plumbers' ship in space and recaptures P'andor.",

Despite Ra'ad's protests, Gwen and Kevin reactivate the Ultimatrix, and separate Ben from the alien. But in doing so, they alert Aggregor to their location. Ra'ad flees, leaving the others to be wiped out by the Osmosian.
